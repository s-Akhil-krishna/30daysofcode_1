Competetive programming is the best way to unleash one's real problem solving potential. Take a look at what I'm upto.
I have chosen C++ as my programming language.

1)fibonocci series
 series : 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,........
 1st number:0  2nd number:1  .........
 Find the N th number of the above sequence. N>=1
 series 
 fibonocci(n)=fibonnoci(n-1)+fibonocci(n-2)
 
 Solution:
 3 possible solutions are given in the repository ranging from naive approach to optimized ones.
